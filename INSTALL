To build dsoextractfw from source, you need bfd. Under Debian or Ubuntu you can just install the package libbfd-dev. I don't know the package names for other distributions but they may be similar.

After you've installed the requirements run the following commands inside the directory of this package:
$ ./configure
$ make

Now place the DSO*1.SYS file that came with the windows driver for your oscilloscope into the same directory and run:
$ ./dsoextractfw <driver file>

This should create two .hex files. Copy them to /usr/local/share/hantekdso/ and copy the 90-hantek-dso.rules file to /etc/udev/rules.d/. To load the firmware you have to install fxload.
After restarting udev your oscilloscope should be initialized automatically after connecting it to the computer (You have to reconnect it after installing this package).

If you can't run OpenHantek as normal user, you have too add your user to the plugdev group.
